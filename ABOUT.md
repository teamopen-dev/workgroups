# About workgroups

Workgroups are responsible for particular tasks within our community.
By letting them be autonomous and responsible for their respective tasks there are two main benefits:

- Authority can be more decentralized.
- Contributors can more easily help with the particular tasks they're interested in.

### Joining/leaving a workgroup

Workgroups are open to anyone. If you're interested, you can join by creating a new issue using
the "Join workgroups" issue template.

Likewise you can leave whenever you like with the "Leave workgroups" issue template.

### Roles within a workgroup

As a first time member you'll likely be assigned a "trial" role first.
Within a workgroup there can be different roles. Each workgroup can define these for themselves.

### Proposing new workgroups

The Governance and Guidance workgroup reviews proposals for new workgroups.
There is no formalized process for this, so feel free to create an issue or reach out to one of the
workgroup members.
